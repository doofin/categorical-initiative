# categorical-initiative
An collaborative learning group to tackle category theory

# why

I spend countless time to learn category theory ,while I still feel that I don't really understand it.I think the only way to actually 'grasp' it is by formalizing it via a programming language.

# How

Dependent type is powerful enough to construct category theory.Agda is one of them,and it also has HoTT formalized.So Agda would be the language of choice
